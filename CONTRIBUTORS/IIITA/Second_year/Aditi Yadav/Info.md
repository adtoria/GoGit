### Issue 223: <br>
#### What do you really understand from SSH keys? What are the advantages of using it? <br>
SSH Keys are <br>
- authentication credentials that manage the connection between local and remote systems. 
- like passwords, but more secure & don't require you to enter your username and password everytime.
- come in pairs of a private key and a public key.
For instance, my GitHub SSH Keys secure the connection between my local systems and my GitHub (remote).

### Issue 366:
#### this is the second commit. i'll retain this one.
- i'll make two commits, push the changes and make a pr
- after that i'll use the command "git rebase -i HEAD~2" to see my last two commits
- in front of the first commit, which i want to delete, i'll replace the "pick" with "drop"
- in this way i'll delete the first commit and push the changes again
